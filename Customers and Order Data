#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity), SUM (quantity)*price as revenue,
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct customer.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) AS Spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers customer
ON Feb.orderid=customer.order_id
WHERE Quantity>2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
SELECT* FROM BIT_DB.FebSales;

#8. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%NY%'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) > 3;


#9. How many of each type of headphone was sold in February?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%headphones%'
GROUP BY Product;


#10. What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hint: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account.)

SELECT SUM(Quantity*price)/COUNT(acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6;


#11. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).

SELECT SUM(Quantity)/COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID)=6;


#12. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product, SUM(price*Quantity) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY revenue desc;
